                    </p>The problem of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been mounting swiftly nowadays among all ages of the human population.
                        Early detection of this neurological disease can greatly assist in the maintenance of the subjectâ€™s mental and physical health.
                        With the rise of application of machine learning-based models in the predictions of various human diseases, their early detection based on various health and physiological parameter now seems possible.
                        This factor motivated us to increase interest in the detection and analysis of ASD diseases to improve better treatment methodology.
                        Detection of ASD becomes a challenge as there are several other mental disorders whose few symptoms are very similar to those with ASD symptoms, thereby makes this task a difficult one.

                    Autism Spectrum disorder is a problem that is related to human brain development. A person who has suffered from the Autism Spectrum Disorder is generally not able to do social interaction and communication with other persons . It is interesting to know that both environmental and genetic factors may turn out to be the causing factors for this disease. The symptoms of this problem may be started at the age of three years and may continue for the lifetime. It is not possible to complete treat the patient suffering from this disease, however its effects can be reduced for some time if the symptoms are early detected. By assuming that human genes are responsible for it, the exact causes of ASD have not been recognized by the scientist yet.  There is some risk factor which influences ASD like as low birth weight, a sibling with ASD and having old parents, etc.
